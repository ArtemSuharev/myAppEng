<h1 align="center">Hello everybody! My name is Timur</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am the developer of the Calculation of recipes app</h3>

<h4 align="left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCalculation of recipes app is a smart notebook where you can save your recipes and use a variety of modes to work with them.</h4>

<h4 align="center">- 1 mode -</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou have a recipe that requires 500 ml of milk, and you only have 300 ml. Write down the quantity of any product, and the application will recalculate the quantity of all other products. The new recipe is ready.</p>

<h4 align="center">- 2 mode -</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSome recipe is designed for, say, 6 servings, and you want to cook for 4 servings. Specify the number of servings in a special column and get the number of products you will need. <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You have found a recipe where a baking dish with a diameter of 21 cm is used, and you only have a mold with a size of 16 cm. Fill in the required fields in this mode and cook in the form that you have. In addition, it is possible to recalculate not only the round shape, but also the rectangular one.</p>

<h4 align="center">- 3 mode -</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring the cooking process, the weight of the dish changes. This mode is designed specifically for calculating the weight of the finished dish. Both the total weight after cooking and the weight change of each product will be calculated. <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For a more accurate calculation, you can edit the change in the weight of products individually.</p>

<h4 align="center">- 4 mode -</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne click on this mode, and you get information about the calorie content of 100 grams of a dish, the 1st serving or the whole dish.</p>	

<h4 align="center">- Shopping lists -</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCreate shopping lists based on recipes so that you don't forget to buy the right products.</p>
	
<h4 align="center">- How does it work? -</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The applications are written in Java for the Android version and in Swift for the iOS version. Android Studio and XCode were used for development, respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To calculate recipes, the usual mathematical operations are used: addition, multiplication, exponentiation and inverses to them. </p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To get acquainted with the application, there are built-in recipes and a little training at the first launch of the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The internal memory of the device is used to store recipes. Firebase is used to synchronize one account on different devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To calculate the caloric content of products, a built-in database of products is used, which contains more than 3000 names of products. The user can personally replenish this database on his device.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To search for products, the Levenshtein algorithm is used, which has been adapted to the specific tasks of the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To calculate the weight change during the preparation of a dish, we use our own developed methodology. The user can change both the weight of an individual product and the total weight of the dish. Algorithms recalculate the rest of the data automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For the convenience of users around the world, the application and the product database have been translated into the most popular languages: English, Spanish, French, Russian, Ukrainian, German, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For the development of the project, built-in paid subscriptions to the extended version of the application are used.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To improve the application, feedback from users is actively used both through reviews in the app store and through mail.</p>
